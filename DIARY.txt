Keeping a dev diary, I'd like to track the design-decision journal
style.

The first several entries will be out of order, as I gather
conversations I've had with myself in code comments over the last two
weeks.


*** Initial Architecture Sun Sep 5 2010

I'm writing the first several implmentations in Java, but decidedly
non-idiomatic Java.

My goal is for my code itself to control as much of the runtime as
possible: the point is to have written and understood as much runtime
as possible, not to leverage Java's runtime efficiently.

So, initial design decisions include:

1. Only relying on things like String, throw, etc. for bootstrap
scaffolding or debugging.

2. Writing the top-level control loop so it can run for some number of
"cycles" and then suspend.  

3. The general contract for the Java implementation is that:

  3a. The main drive() loop is guaranteed to halt.  It runs the VM for
      a particular number of ticks.  Whether the hosted program is
      Halting or no is of course undecidable - but in any case control
      is guaranteed to return to the client.

  3b. The implementation never calls Java's new except in the minimum
      unavoidable cases: when it first initializes its heap and
      registers, and when it resizes its heap: both of which it only
      does when directed by the client.

  3c. The implementation almost never* allows a Java exception to
      cross the implementation's public interface.  The only
      exceptions to this rule are debugging code.  Any exception
      crossing that line are a bug.

  3d. Not using exceptions within the implementation except where
      minimally unavoidable in Java: in the 2 or 3 places where new is
      called.  In those few cases, the exception is dealt with in the
      narrowest possible try{}catch{}.

  3e. Although I use them extensively in the early stages, it is my
      goal to avoid using recursion, loops, or switch statements at
      the Java level.  I *especially* want to avoid using those to
      implement the flow control structure in the Scheme
      implementation e.g. I don't want the Scheme runtime stack to
      just be a mapping onto the Java runtime stack.

These draconian limitation offer a couple of distinctive benefits.

One, once I'm happy with the feature set and the stability of the
implementation, I want a clear and unambiguous porting path to C or
some lower language.

Two, the point of not leveraging those features in Java is that I want
to *implement* those features for myself.  I want to implement a
runtime stack, I want to implement garbage collection, that's an
inherent and central part of my motivation.

Three, by being less shackled from the Java runtime, I am free to
explore things which are unsupported by the Java runtime, like proper
tail recursion, tail recursion modulo cons, and continuation passing
style.


At the lowest level, I'm using Java to implement a custom register
machine whose primitive opcodes are tailored to support a LISP
machine.  I'm also using Java to write the microcoding for that LISP
machine.  As I move along, I'm kind of trying to identify the simplest
possible core LISP interpreter which is sufficiently full featured but
algorithmically efficient, and at the same time the simplest possible
operand set I can come up with.  That is, without sacrificing
generality of fundamental performance, I'm co-optimizing for
medium-level and lowest-level complexity.

Eventually, I'd like to see those roles decoupled, for the
assembly which implements the LISP to be pulled out into a distinct
file, and the Java to become no more than the CPU+REG+RAM simulator.

Then, I'd like to start playing with implementations of that VM in
multiple languages, compiled for multiple runtimes, etc...


*** Improper Lists Sun Sep 5 2010

Guile does this:

   ( . 2 ) ===> 2

That is, with nothing before the dot in a dotted list, you just get
the last thing.

I had noticed this, but not understood it, when I tried it on an early
form of my (read (print)) loop.  I was pleasantly surprised to find my
loop behaving the same way.

Made me feel warm and fuzzy, like this is a funny edge case in the
definition and my implementation was faithful enough to the definition
that it exhibits the same edge cases, although I did not anticipate
them at time of implementation.
      
Still, this demands I meditate on why this is.  I *think* that (read)
is building an outer cons cell, but I don't understand how the
processing of the dot, on the inside, would unmake the cell on the
outside.


*** The quote-quote-quote problem

Trouble!

  jwillett@little-man ~/jhwscm $ scsh
  Welcome to scsh 0.6.7 (R6RS)
  Type ,? for help.
  > ''1
  ''1
  > (quote 1)
  1
  > '1
  1
  > ' '1
  ''1
  > (quote '1)
  ''1
  > 
  Exit Scsh? (y/n)? y
  jwillett@little-man ~/jhwscm $ guile
  guile> ''1
  (quote 1)
  guile> (quote 1)
  1
  guile> '1
  1
  guile> ' '1
  (quote 1)
  guile> (quote '1)
  (quote 1)
  guile> 
  
OK, so scsh makes the decision to print quote as ' instead
of as (quote) - no biggie.  But notice the last thing:
  
  [scsh]> (quote '1)
  ''1
  
  guile> (quote '1)
  (quote 1)
  
Scsh comes back with two levels of quoting, Guile with
one.  I'm gonna have to see if this is something clarified
by R6RS (noting that Scsh calls R6RS and knowing Guile
defaults to around R5RSish), or if it is a bug in one of
the two, or if it remains an open design decision.
  
Damn, had a real problem getting any other Schemes to work
in Gentoo.
  
Aha!  With less weight as evidence perhaps, but I can try
the same thing in various non-Scheme LISPs!
  
From GNU Emacs (duh, it was right there all along!):
  
  (quote 1)                 
  ==> 1
  '1                        
  ==> 1
  (quote (quote 1))
  ==> (quote 1)
  ''1
  ==> (quote 1)
  (quote (quote (quote 1)))
  ==> (quote (quote 1))
  '''1
  ==> (quote (quote 1))
  (quote '1)
  ==> (quote 1)
  
From GNU CLISP:
  
  [1]> '1
  1
  [2]> ''1
  '1
  [3]> '''1
  ''1
  [4]> (quote 1)
  1
  [5]> (quote (quote 1))
  '1
  [6]> (quote (quote (quote 1)))
  ''1
  [7]> (quote '1)
  '1
  
OK, so we have:  
  
  1. Scsh and CLISP print quote in the ' form.
  
  2. Guile and Emacs print quote in the (quote) form.
  
  3. Scsh and CLISP print quote in the ' form.
  
  4. Scsh interprets (quote '1) as two levels of
  quotation.
  
  5. Guile, CLISP, and Emacs, interpret (quote '1) as a
  single level of quotation.
  
No consensus on how to print - fine, I am comfortable
making up my own mind on that.

For the (quote '1) problem, the vote is leaning toward a single level
of quotation.  Mind you, that's how it is printed, not what it *is*.
I think of the print operation in this survey as "stripping off one
level of quote".

With that in mind, I'd like to see all ofboth (quote
(quote 1)), (quote '1), '(quote 1), and ''1 print the
same, as either '1 or (quote 1).

Guile, Emacs, and CLISP all do this.  Scsh is treats ' and
quote consistently, but it breaks the "stripping off one
level of quote" rule by it printing ''1 for ''1 but 1 for
'1.

So I'm going with the striping off one level of quote rule
in guiding how print works.  The question is open whether
I want to print the long form or the apostrophe form.

I am likely to go with apostrophe for the sorterness of
it, even though I look to Guile in other matters.  The
apostrophe, being a lexical token, can't be redefined the
way "quote" can and I don't want redefinitions of quote
breaking homoiconicity.

Follow-on observation: what happens to apostrophe when you
redefine quote? For the following input:

  (define quote 1)
  '3

Both Guile and Scsh fail, saying more or less that I tried to apply 1
as a function to 3, and I can't do that.  So... both of them have 'X
expand to (quote X) via the *symbol* "quote", not the builtin
operation to which "quote" is commonly bound.  Interesting.

In the LISP-2s I don't know quite what to expect, but whatever happens
I do not think it is applicable, since LISP-2's have complex symbols
and, if I recall, a different slot in the symbols for each of values,
procedures, macros, and special forms (among other things).  From
CLISP:

  [1]> (defvar quote 1)
  QUOTE
  [2]> (quote 1)
  1
  [3]> (defun quote () 1)
  
  *** - DEFUN/DEFMACRO: QUOTE is a special operator and
        may not be redefined.
  
So I can't redefine "quote", so I can't see what effect that has on
apostrophe.
  
Interesting!  I'm gonna have to mine R5RS and R6RS on this one.



TODO: on the initial environment problem, printability of
    primitives, unification of sub_foo and (foo).


*** Struggles with unification of sub_foo and foo.

Struggles: args-to-registers loading for TYPE_SUB?  Do we even let
TYPE_SUB be directly invokable?  Or are the builtins a distinct
namespace?
 
Mon Aug 30 07:49:58 PDT 2010: OK, here's the deal.  I'm having a rough
time getting past this point: it feels like I need to make several
design decisions and tricky implementations all at once:

  1. How to distinguish built-in special forms from built-in
     functions.

  2. Whether to allow user code to directly invoke built-ins, or
     whether to have them in some distinct namespace.

  3. How to pass arguments: so far, we've used 2 registers, but with
     longer argument lists that breaks down eventually.  Do we go
     absolute, and require all args to everything always be in a list?
     Would this mean reimplementing all the existing sub_foo?  What
     about primitives?  Should they be the same?  E.g. if args must be
     in a list, how would we implement (cons)?

  4. How to represent user-defined special forms and functions?

  5. How to seed the top-level environment with bindings for
     primitives?

  6. How (and whether) to seed the top-level environment with bindings
     for non-primitives?

  7. Whether and how to support direct lexical reference to primitives
     e.g. can the user do "#<+>" and get the primitive adder
     regardless of how "+" may have been defined or redefined?

Gotta figure out how to make decisions about fewer of these at a time,
in a seperately implementable and testable way.

Feeling: I'd kind of like to end up with the most primitivemost Scheme
engine when I'm done, one which perhaps defines no top-level
environment whatsoever.  That would suggest supporting creation of the
standard top-level environment as library code.  That library code
might have to look like:

  (#<def> define #<def>)
  (define + #<+>)
  (define cons #<cons>)
  ... 

I like this from two points of view: "the language is implemented in
itself" and also "maintain a draconian constraint of the featureset
scope of the lower-level components".  The downside is finding that
syntax for unbound primitives.

OK, that answers 5-7, but leaves 1-4 open.  Still, gives me something
to do while Enkidu works on the open questions.

Hmm, still begs the question: where does this "namespace" for
primitives live.  I think it belongs hard-coded somewhere in
sub_read_foo.  If we call it a special frame in the global environment
(which is protected from mutation after initialization) then we're
just back where we started.

A short expression of the two main quandaries: how do I bind "define"
to the thing which does name binding?  And to what do I bind "+"?

Answers 5-7: definitely moving toward a special lexical-level binding
for primitivemost built-ins.  I'm thinking really low level, like only
"binary fixint add" and not "full numeric tower variadic add".  Higher
adds can be defined as accumulations, etc.

Answers 1-4: Introduced ARITY_MASK, A0, A1, AX, etc to encode arity.
In the case of sub_foo, the arity is encoded within the opcode itself
- this can be used for internal error-checking in gosub(), but will
also be used in sub_eval to help marshal higher-level code on its way
to the various sub_foo.

Higher-level code of course passes arguments through name bindings, so
that's not an issue.

Higher-level code will enjoy a distinct sentinel for IS_PROCEDURE and
IS_SPECIAL_FORM.  I forked TYPE_SUB into TYPE_SUBP and TYPE_SUBS for
sub_foo which act like procedures or special forms, respectively.

sub_eval is going to be complicated....


*** Thinking about the problem of tracking the current env.

Obviously we need the notion of the current env tracked someplace.
Without it, when something lie sub_if calls sub_eval, what env would
sub_eval use?

Do we track the current frame in:

  - The regular stack?

  - A dedicated stack?

  - Argument passing?

I like argument passing b/c it is clean and doesn't introduce another
global.  I dislike argument passing for more reasons than just the
tedious billion register operations it will take to implement it that
way.  On second though, it is only clean when I am using my Java
sensibilities, where I greatly prefer args to object state.  Here I'm
looking at VM state, so it might be OK to let myself think
differently.

I have another reason to dislike argument passing.  It means things
like sub_define will take a different number of arguments than the
higher-level (define).  That feels bunk.  I am keen on the microcoded
buitins *being* the high-level forms, not just helpers for them.

I dislike like putting the current env in a dedicated stack. That
feels like needless multiplication of entities.

I like putting the current env on the regular stack, but how does it
get found by calls like sub_if?  It could be arbitrarily many calls up
the stack in the past that a new current stack got pushed.

Thinking about the current env ebbing and flowing, it feels stack-y,
like a much colder stack than the regular one.  It doesn't shimmer, it
throbs.

So, maybe... the current env gets a register, but we push and pop onto
the regular stack?

Naa... wait a sec, the env is recursively structured and stack-like
already.  Why not just stop calling it the regGlobalEnv, instead call
it regEnv... and push and pop there?

Hmmm, I'm liking it.  Names getting shorter, if b/c they've dropped
qualifications and become general, is a good smell.

OK, the plan is the env gets a dedicated stack - but the stack it gets
is in the reg it already has.  We just use that reg more dynamically.

Wait, did I just describe an implementation of dynamic scoping?  Well,
we'll try it and see.


*** Struggles with (let)

HEY DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!

(let) is *not* fundamental.  It is a syntax over (lambda).

That this first impl was so simple means either this impl is
insufficient, or that sub_lambda is overly complicated.

   * Sidebar: the first impl was:

     case sub_let:
        store(reg[regArg1]);              // store body
        gosub(sub_let_bindings,sub_let+0x1);
        break;
     case sub_let+0x1:
        reg[regTmp0] = restore();         // restore body
        reg[regTmp1] = cons(reg[regRetval],reg[regEnv]);
        reg[regEnv]  = reg[regTmp1];
        reg[regArg0] = reg[regTmp0];
        reg[regArg1] = reg[regEnv];
        gosub(sub_eval,blk_tail_call);
        break;

     Several problems here:
  
       1. It only accepted a single expression for the body (instead
          of many expressions evaluated in an implicit (begin)).

       2. It sets reg[regEnv] which is supposed to be the job of
          sub_apply or sub_eval.

       3. It never restores reg[regEnv] when finished, effectively
          "leaking" an environment frame and exposing its symbols to
          its continuation.

       I was wary of (1) and (2) when I wrote this, but missed (3).

I doubt sub_lambda is overly complicated.  Try reimplementing this as
an expansion to a lambda form.

Side comment: I was thinking that (define) was also non-fundamental.
Only half true.  The simple form of it is needed b/c it creates new
symbol bindings in existing environment frames, wheras lambda creates
new frames.  The procedure style of (define), however, is just a
syntax over the simple form of (define) and (lambda) - which of course
is how it is implemented now.

Exploring let-as-syntax

  (let ((a 1)) (+ a 2)) 

  ((lambda (a) (+ a 2)) 1)

  (let ((a 1) (b 2)) (+ a b))

  ((lambda (a b) (+ a b)) 1 2)

I notice a couple things that are good.  

One, in each equivalent pair both the let and lambda expressions have
identical numbers of atoms.

Two, in the first pair there are an equal number of '(', and in the
second pair the lambda expression has fewer '('.

So the lambda form Pareto dominates the let form for space: same
number of leaves, less internal nesting.

Three, the second lambda form reassuringly creates a single
environment frame holding both a and b, but evaluates the bound values
in the outer environment.  So neither a nor be could be a simple
expression involving a or b, but both could be procedure defines
invoking both a and be.  E.g. a and b could be a metacircular mutually
recursive pair, and this would work.  Which is what I expect from
(let) - I think.  Or would that be letrec?

Quick, to the Bat-R5RS!

  In a let expression, the initial values are computed before any of
  the variables become bound; in a let* expression, the bindings and
  evaluations are performed sequentially; while in a letrec
  expression, all the bindings are in effect while their initial
  values are being computed, thus allowing mutually recursive
  definitions.

OK, I got all worked up, our (let)==>(lambda) examples above are
right.  In:

  ((lambda (a b) (+ a b)) 1 2)

If the expressions 1 or 2 were instead lambda expressions, their
lexical scopes would *not* enjoy bindings for either a or b.

Hmmm, OK, so they can't be mutually recursive, but shouldn't one of
the be able to be self-recursive? I mean, this works:

  (define (fact n) 
    (let ((h 
           (lambda (n a) (if (< n 2) a (h (- n 1) (* n a))))
         ))
      (help n 1)))

Right?  Ho-ho!  Guile rejects it!  (fact 1) works fine, (fact 2) gets
"Unbound variable: h".

OK, so the lambda expansion looks correct, for better or worse.  Which
is a relief.
