/**
 * Mem.java

 * Abstraction of a memory bank: main RAM, an intermediate cache, a
 * register bank, etc.
 *
 * Going OO here even where performance may be critical b/c I intend a
 * number of distinct implementations, both for exploring how much
 * Java costs and for various debugging and machine-architecture
 * experiments.
 *
 * Because this is a test/support layer, unlike JhwScm this is allowed
 * to throw exceptions on misuse.  JhwScm is responsible for making
 * sure that never happens!
